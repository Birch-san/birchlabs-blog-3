This is just an experiment. [birchlabs-frontpage-2](https://github.com/Birch-san/birchlabs-frontpage-2) is still king.

Trying to use [static-site-generator-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/markdalgleish/static-site-generator-webpack-plugin) in order to re-use partials.

Conclusion:

Not fit for purpose; does not support webpack-dev-server (or at least does not support hot reload)
